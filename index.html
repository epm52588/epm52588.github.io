<h1> ATLANTA HAWKS </h1>

  <a href="http://www.nba.com/hawks/">HAWK's Nest</a> 


<p> The <em>HAWKS</em> are based in Atlanta and is a member of the Eastern Conference Southeast Division. The team’s origins can be traced to the establishment of the Tri-Cities Blackhawks in 1946 in Moline, Illinois. In 1951 the team was moved to Milwaukee, where they changed their name to the Hawks. Milwaukee Hawks was short-lived, by 1955 they were moved to St. Lous where they would win their first championship in 1958. In 1968, they were moved for the last time where the Hawks would stay in Atlanta.</p>

				
<p>Last season the <em>HAWKS</em> finished there season with a 48-34 record in the regular season. Although they ended their regular season with a positive record, their success in the playoffs was short-lived. The <em>HAWKS</em> managed to beat the <small>Boston Celtics</small> 4-2, but lost the series against the <small>Cleveland Cavaliers 0-4.</small> </p>

				
<p>With the No. 21 overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft, the <em>HAWKS</em> selected DeAndre Bembry. Bombay is a forward out of St. Joe’s and is a versatile forward who finishes at the basket, but is lacking a jump shot. However, he could be a good addition to the Hawks if he’s developed properly. <mark>Fortunately, the <em>HAWKS</em> also picked up Dwight Howard as a free agent. Howard should be able to pick up Bombay’s slack, and bring the <em>HAWKS</em> to a promising season.</mark></p>
